# Kivy Examples (robertour.com)

that doesn't make any sense... can you repeat it again?
--------------------------------------------------------

So, I decided to upload the examples that I have created for my blog ([robertour.com](www.robertour.com)). It will take me some time to upload them all because they are all over the place in my old hard drives.

I hope people find them useful. The examples that I have created over time helps to compliment [my Kivy book](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kivy-interactive-applications-python-second-edition). By the way, the examples of the first edition are already available in [Github](https://github.com/robertour/kivy-book-examples).
